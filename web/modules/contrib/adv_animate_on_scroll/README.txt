Advanced animate on scroll
======

The advanced animate on scroll module allows you to include animations to the
fields of your content.

Each field can have its own animation independent of the rest.

Once the animation is enabled, you just have to select the animation to apply in
the list.

We are working with the most stable version of AOS, but we do not rule out using
version 3 when it is stable.

The javascript library to provide the animations are the work of michalsnik.

For more information about the library you can consult the original project:
